Striver A2Z - Solve Problems on Arrays (Easy -> Medium -> Hard)

Easy
1) Largest element in an array
2) Second largest element in an array
3) Check if array is sorted
4) Remove duplicates from sorted array
5) Left rotate an array by one
6) Left rotate an array by D places
7) Move zeros to the end
8) Linear search in an array
9) Union of two sorted arrays
10) Missing number in array [0..n]
11) Max consecutive ones
12) Number that appears once (every other appears twice)
13) Find the frequency of each element (basic map)
14) Longest subarray with sum K (positive numbers, sliding window)
15) Two Sum (unsorted)

Medium
1) Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s (Dutch National Flag)
2) Majority Element (n/2)
3) Kadane's Algorithm (Maximum subarray sum)
4) Stock Buy and Sell - Max profit
5) Rearrange array elements by sign (alternating positives/negatives)
6) Next permutation
7) Leaders in an array
8) Longest consecutive sequence
9) Set matrix zeroes
10) Rotate matrix by 90 degrees
11) Spiral traversal of matrix
12) Count subarrays with sum K (can include negatives)
13) Subarray sum divisible by K
14) Three Sum (find triplets with sum 0)
15) Four Sum (find quadruplets with target)

Hard
1) Maximum product subarray
2) Longest subarray with 0 sum
3) Largest subarray with equal 0s and 1s
4) Number of subarrays with XOR = K
5) Merge overlapping intervals
6) Insert interval
7) Merge two sorted arrays in-place (Gap method)
8) Count inversions in an array
9) Reverse pairs (count pairs i<j with arr[i] > 2*arr[j])
10) Median of two sorted arrays
