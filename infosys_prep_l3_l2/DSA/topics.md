## My plan
- [ ] Complete and revise graph playlist from codestorywithmik
- [ ] Complete and revise DP from striver
- [ ] Complete DP playlist from codestorywithmik
- [ ] In parallel, revise Segment Trees, DSU
- [ ] DP new topics:
  - [ ] digit DP (already aata hai aur hard questions krne hai)
  - [ ] bitmask dp
  - [ ] dp on trees
  - [ ] dp on graph
- [ ] string algorithms
- [ ] trie data structure
- [ ] segment trees questions
- [ ] fenwick trees concept and questions
- [ ] game theory
